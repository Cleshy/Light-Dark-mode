## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I've just finished my Light - Dark Mode project via Zero To Mastery Academy.

This was a really good project to practice JavaScript, but I was thinking about responsive design since I started the project, so I did it.

I know, it's not the best, but it's a New Year, with a lot of opportunity to learn âœŒ

I hope you like it. ðŸš€

Happy New Year all. âœ¨ðŸŽ‰
